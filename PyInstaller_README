The following is the steps involved in compiling a distributable version of MoleX:

Note: If PyInstaller says any errors about permissions, try running as root (administrator on windows)

1. Open a terminal in the directory of the GUI
2. $ pyinstaller moleculex.py (*)
3. copy (resources, OpenGL, trimesh, stl_files, Icons.qrc, Icons_rc.py, Icons.pyc) into dist/moleculex
4. delete dist/moleculex/share (on linux)
5 (Linux). navigate to dist/moleculex and run $ ./moleculex
5 (Windows). navigate to dist/moleculex and double-click moleculex.exe



(*): If error "ValueError: script '/path/to/file/moleculex.py' not found" appears

    1. delete moleculex.spec
    2. delete help.spec
    3. delete build folder
    4. delete dist folder
    5. restart terminal
